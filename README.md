Run the command shown below and then navigate to `https://localhost:5001` in your browser of choice where you'll be preesented with the Orchard setup page.

    dotnet run --project src/DannyT.OrchardCore.Site

Open the solution in Visual Studio and run the `DannyT.OrchardCore.Site` project. This will open your default browser and you'll be presented with the Orchard setup page.
